This portfolio showcases my work as part of my Level 6 Data Science apprenticeship.

It includes:
- Work-based projects completed during my apprenticeship (code cannot be shared due to confidentiality)
- Independent and public data science projects
- Technical cheat sheets and learning notes

## About Me
I'm a data science apprentice with a background in forensic science and clinical research, currently working towards a Level 6 Data Science degree apprenticeship after recently completing a Level 4 Data Analyst apprenticeship (September 2025).

My work to date has focused on optimising and automating processes, with particular emphasis on building modular, reusable Python functions to improve efficiency, consistency, and maintainability.

Through my apprenticeship, I'm developing experience across statistics, machine learning, and data engineering, while continuing to refine my interests within the field.
